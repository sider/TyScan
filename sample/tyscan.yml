# A rule (each item in `rules`) is a

  - # The identifier of a rule. This must be unique in a config file.
    id: sample.console

    # The code pattern to find. This pattern finds any method call to `console` with any argument
    # set. See https://github.com/sider/TyScan/blob/master/doc/pattern.md for more details.
    pattern: console._(...)

    # The message to display when TyScan finds a code piece that matches the pattern.
    message: Do not use `console`.

    # You can check whether the pattern works as expected with `tyscan test`. See
    # https://github.com/sider/TyScan/blob/master/doc/cli.md#test-your-patterns for more details.
    tests:
      # Code pieces that are expected to match the pattern.
      match:
        - console.log('Log message');
        - console.error('Error message');

      # Code pieces that are NOT expected to match the pattern.
      unmatch:
        - console; # This does not match the pattern since no method is invoked.
